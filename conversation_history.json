The loan account will be marked as \u201cclosed\u201d with no outstanding dues.\n42. Can I request EMI waiver while foreclosing?\nRarely approved, but can be considered under hardship or negotiation cases.\n43. Can I foreclose one of multiple loans only?\nYes, each loan account is independent and can be foreclosed separately.\n44. Can I foreclose without penalty if I pay from my salary?\nForeclosure fee exemptions are not tied to income source unless specified under a corporate or\ngovernment scheme.\n45. Are foreclosure terms same for personal and home loans?\nNo. Home loans often have lower or zero charges (for floating rates), while personal loans may\ncarry 2\u20135% foreclosure fees.\n5",
